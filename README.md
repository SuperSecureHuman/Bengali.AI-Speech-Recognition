# Bengali.AI-Speech-Recognition

My work towards ![Bengali Speech Recognition Competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bengaliai-speech/)

Trying to use the most out of the data available.

Datasets

[ ] Common Voice 14.0
[ ] OpenSLR
[ ] Google Fleurs
[ ] Bengali.AI Kaggle Dataset

## Current Training motive

Train whisper-small on all of these datasets.

## Future Work

Once I get compute access, I would like to train either medium, or large variant of whisper on all of these datasets to compare the performance.


## Checklist(?)

### Whisper Small

[ ] Common Voice 14.0
[ ] OpenSLR
